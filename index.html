                <p><b>JavaScript + .NET Project:</b> This project allows to administrate e-money subsystem of bigger SOA system. Mostly it plays role of data aggregation with CRUD capability. At backend it collaborates with DBs, WCF services and other http REST resources.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="panel-body">
                <p><b>Tasks performed:</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I made from scratch design of architecture as well as implementation of all details in frontend and backend</li>
                  <li>SPA front-end was created using Webpack, React, Redux</li>
                  <li>Because of ES6 coding style in project, initially Babel loader was used in Webpack and later I did upgrade to Webpack 3 and converted source code into TypeScript</li>
                  <li>I wrote an engine for rendering UI with many extension points in it for more flexible behavior</li>
                  <li>DevExtreme, Bootstrap and W3.CSS components were used in drawing UI</li>
                  <li>Made routing support with beautiful URL view and refresh support</li>
                  <li>React performance optimization API as well as Redux selectors were used</li>
                  <li>I used hot module reloading for instant UI update in browser without reloading whole page or losing Redux state while developing</li>
                  <li>For testing purposes I used Webpack-dev-server with hot module reloading or Karma runner. They both used Mocha, Chai, Enzyme, Sinon and code coverage tools to generate live html reports dynamically</li>
                  <li>TeamCity and Travis CI were used as CI. Slack channel was used as additional report output. After successful build run code coverage metrics are sent to Coveralls to be able to view results</li>
                  <li>JSON was used as a DTO between client and server</li>
                  <li>Initially back-end side was made as https RESTful OWIN Web API Service and then I rewrote it to ASP.NET Core Service</li>
                  <li>Made RESTful ASP.NET Core Service with OAuth JWT at the back-end side</li>
                  <li>Server side supports GZip compression if client sets necessary headers</li>
                  <li>In Web API project, I used StructureMap as DI framework and later I switched it to Simple Injector because last one is faster. Now I use DI from ASP.NET Core because it is native for framework and fast</li>
                  <li>For some API calls cache was implemented to reduce load to external services</li>
                  <li>API call caching, compression, logging and several other things were implemented as middleware</li>
                  <li>TPL Dataflow was used as approach to implement my own in-process pipelining/message passing because backend plays role of data aggregation</li>
                  <li>Domain objects are implemented as POCO objects and Dapper ORM is used to work with DB</li>
                  <li>I used Serilogger in this project to implement structured logging. Logging in to txt or json files, Windows EventLog, Seq and Slack services was implemented. I wrote my own asynchronous Slack sink because all existing Slack sinks have poor API to produce rich message body</li>

                  <li>Capability to bind in xaml ViewModel to any event in View without loosing method signature or type information was implemented</li>
                  <li>Made architecture of Model as state full Domain Model with lazy load. My engine, reused for fourth time, is core of it</li>
                  <li>Most of business objects and related SQL queries are code generated at runtime from database schema</li>
                  <li>I made dynamic filtering capability</li>
                  <li>View of foreign key cells can be redefined by user. He/she can define masks for any type fields as well as for object entirely</li>
                  <li>I made design like PropertyEditorControl in WinForm to edit object. It has capability to edit complex fields via custom UI</li>
                  <li>Capability to have in right click menu option “Navigate to child” when it was done on foreign key cell</li>

Data storage separated on OLTP and OLAP subsystems. OLAP database is used for reporting subsystem. Interaction with OLTP subsystem accomplish via channels such as TPC (for devices), HTTP (reporting system), WCF (tcp, http, pipe for local admin only), FTP (processing of device reports), etc.</p>

                  <li>I made redesign of architecture of reporting subsystem at backend side</li>
                  <li>I did RPC migration from .NET Remoting to WCF</li>
